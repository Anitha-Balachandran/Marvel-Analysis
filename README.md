Marvel Analysis - A Data Visualization project
The Marvel Analysis Data Visualization Project aims to provide a data-driven exploration into the Marvel Universe. Data sources such as Marvel's public API and web scraping methods are employed to gather a comprehensive dataset that includes character attributes, story arcs, and other metrics. Python libraries are used for data exploration and cleaning. The curated data is stored in an optimized database, facilitating efficient retrieval for analysis. Advanced data visualization techniques are applied through Tableau and Power BI to create preliminary visual narratives. The project culminates in an HTML dashboard that showcases the final analysis, featuring interactive visualizations and dynamic dashboards. This HTML dashboard serves as the central platform where fans, researchers, and analysts can explore various facets of the Marvel Universe, from character evolution to thematic trends. Beyond its visual appeal, the project delivers actionable insights, making it a valuable resource for multiple audiences.
